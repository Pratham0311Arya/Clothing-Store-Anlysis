## Data Cleaning

### Dropping Columns
We started by cleaning the raw data, which involved dropping columns that were not relevant to our analysis. Specifically, we removed the "Currency" and "Ship-Country" columns as they were not essential for our analysis. Also cleaned up other columns such as "Gender" and "Quantity" to ensure consistency and accuracy in our analysis.

## Data Analysis

### Pivot Tables
Using Excel's pivot tables, we analyzed the sales data to gain insights into various aspects of the business, such as sales by product category, sales by region, and sales over time.

### Charts and Visualizations
We created several charts and visualizations to better understand the sales trends and patterns. These included bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to represent different aspects of the data.

### Dashboard Creation
To provide a comprehensive overview of the sales performance, we built a dashboard that consolidated key metrics and visualizations. This dashboard allowed stakeholders to quickly grasp the insights derived from the data.
